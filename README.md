# ArchLinux Autorising Script

This is my personal archlinux autorising script called ALAS for short, which runs on fresh system with ArchLinux installed.
It installs all programs I use located in file programs.csv, additionally it installs dwm (window manager), st (suckless terminal) and dmenu.

## How to use it?
  - Clone the script `git clone https://github.com/11me/alas`
  - Edit global variables at the beginnig of the script for your personal needs
  - And run the script `./alas.sh`
  - Follow the instructions
